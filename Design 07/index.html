                <p class="maintxt">Environmental pollution encompasses air, water, and soil pollution as it affects every aspect of nature. When an element cannot be destroyed by nature, it will cause harm and recovery can take from days to thousands of years. Since the
                    Industrial Revolution, the levels of environmental pollution have only increased. So which practice contributes the most to environmental pollution?</p>
                <h4>Chemicals in Agriculture</h4>
                <p>While the concept of agriculture might not raise too many eyebrows, current trends see the increased use of pesticides which contaminate the soil and water. Almost all pesticides are made from chemical compounds meant to drive away pests
                    harmful to the crops. And because there is an increased demand for food production due to globalization, their use has intensified as well to keep up with the demand. Moreover, by cleaning more land to set up pastures and crops, agriculture
                    can also contribute to the disruption of biodiversity and resource depletion.</p>
                <h4>Burning Fossil Fuels</h4>
                <p>Since the booming of the industry, fossil fuels have been the main source of energy. Fossil fuels have taken the shape of coal, oil and natural gas. It is interesting to notice that they are not a renewable source of energy, yet we use
                    them widely and massively to power our homes and cars. It is cheap and easy to mine, but the process that produced fossil fuels took millions of years. If they run out, they cannot be restocked as humans cannot produce fossil fuels.
                    The only way fossil fuels produce energy is by burning them. The hydrocarbons that exist in fossil fuels store energy in the form of atomic bonds that can only be released through combustion.</p>
                <h3>What Can We Do to Reduce Environmental Pollution?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch to Hybrid cars and electric cars-Electric vehicles as public transportation would also be an important element in reducing the formation of smog in urban areas.</li>
                    <li>Generate power through eco-friendly technologies-eco-friendly means of transportation would be a major step in the direction of reducing gas emissions. while coal power plants are not such a big</li>
                    <li>Use energy efficient appliances-on a small scale, you can reduce environmental pollution by buying appliances according to their energy rating label.</li>
                </ul>
